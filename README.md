# Geolocation Profiler

Run in node.js; Built using ReactJS components and a MongoDB database

## Setup

First install mongodb on your host machine:
https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/

Once mongodb is working, clone the repository. Open a terminal and navigate to the new repository location (i.e. home/360app), then run:

```
npm install
```

```
webpack
```
```
node server.js
```

This will start a server on localhost, which you can visit at http://localhost:3000/. Your database will be empty, since it's being hosted on your machine.
